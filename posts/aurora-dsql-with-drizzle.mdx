# Aurora DSQL Setup with Drizzle

Amazon recently launched a new service called Aurora DSQL, which they describe as:

> The fastest serverless distributed SQL database for always available applications.

Whether or not this claim holds true, Aurora DSQL addresses several critical gaps AWS had in the "database" space. It introduces an offering that allows developers to create side projects with the ability to scale to zero—a game-changer for cost-conscious development. Previously, using Aurora for side projects often felt excessive due to its pricing model. This led many developers, myself included, to resort to alternatives like DynamoDB, a basic RDS setup, or even third-party managed services like PlanetScale.

Now, with Aurora DSQL, I can set up a fully managed, serverless, distributed SQL database with minimal effort and without worrying about runaway costs. AWS appears to have filled a significant gap with this offering, making it an attractive choice for projects where scalability and cost-efficiency are key. So far, I haven’t been surprised by unexpected bills, and the simplicity of managing this service feels like a major step forward for AWS in the database ecosystem.

Seeing as I use TypeScript for most of my side projects, I want to show how easy it is to connect DSQL to an ORM like Drizzle.

## Creating Your First Cluster

### **1. Search for Aurora DSQL**
- Navigate to the **RDS** section in the AWS Management Console.
- Search for **Aurora DSQL** in the database options.

---

### **2. Input Cluster Criteria**
- Configure the cluster according to your needs:
  - For this walkthrough, we’ll **leave linked regions off** and **enable deletion protection**.
  - These settings are optional for this tutorial but are highly recommended for production environments.

---

### **3. Wait for the Cluster to Activate**
- Once the cluster is created, its status will initially show as **Creating**.
- Wait for the status to change to **Active**.

Following these steps, you’ll have a functional Aurora DSQL cluster ready for your applications. In the next steps, we’ll explore connecting to this cluster and integrating it with **Drizzle ORM**. Stay tuned!

## Connecting to Your Cluster

Now that you have created your cluster, we should connect to it to ensure everything is working correctly before proceeding further.

### **1. Note Down Your Cluster Endpoint and Connect via Your Terminal**
Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
PGSSLMODE=require \
psql --dbname postgres \
--username admin \
--host <endpoint>
```

Upon successful connection, you should see a prompt like this:

```bash
postgres=>
```

> If prompted for a password for the user admin, you can generate a temporary 15-minute password by clicking Connect in the console. Password rotation will be handled automatically later using Drizzle.

## Configure your cluster for development

While you can use Drizzle to create and manage your schema, we’ll manually create it for this walkthrough.

Run the following SQL commands while connected to your database:

```SQL
CREATE SCHEMA "davedennis_dev";
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS davedennis_dev.posts (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    slug VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    cover_image VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```

With the schema created, we can proceed to set up our Drizzle project. Stay tuned for the next steps!

## Connect to the Database with Drizzle

This guide shows how to set up and connect to a database using Bun and Drizzle ORM.

1. Initialize the Project
Start by creating a new project with Bun:
```bash
bun init
```
Delete the default index.ts file that was generated.
2. Update package.json

Modify the package.json file to look like this:
```json
{
  "name": "@dsqr/api",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node dist/index.js",
    "dev": "tsup --watch --onSuccess \"node dist/app.local.cjs\"",
    "build": "tsup",
    "clean": "rm -rf dist",
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit",
    "lint": "eslint src/"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@aws-sdk/dsql-signer": "^3.705.0",
    "drizzle-orm": "^0.37.0",
    "pg": "^8.13.1",
    "pg-pool": "^3.7.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/node": "^20.11.24",
    "tsup": "^8.0.2",
    "typescript": "^5.3.3"
  }
}
```
3. Update tsconfig.json

Replace the tsconfig.json with the following configuration:
```json
{
  "extends": "@tsconfig/node20/tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "declaration": true,
    "module": "nodenext",
    "target": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "nodenext",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["src"],
  "exclude": ["test", "dist"]
}
```

4. Set Up the Database Connection

Create a src/db directory, then add an index.ts file with the following content:

```typescript
import pg from "pg";
import { DsqlSigner } from "@aws-sdk/dsql-signer";
const { Pool } = pg;
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/node-postgres";
import { postsTable } from "./schema.js";

const region = "us-east-1";
const hostname = "54abtvzm25xz52v2z2gbfn53uu.dsql.us-east-1.on.aws";
const database = "postgres";

let tokenExpiry: Date | null = null;
let pool: pg.Pool | null = null;

const getAuthToken = async (): Promise<string> => {
  const signer = new DsqlSigner({ hostname, region });
  const token = await signer.getDbConnectAdminAuthToken();

  tokenExpiry = new Date(Date.now() + 13 * 60 * 1000); // Valid for 15 minutes
  return token;
};

const getDatabasePool = async (): Promise<pg.Pool> => {
  if (pool && tokenExpiry && tokenExpiry > new Date()) {
    return pool;
  }

  const token = await getAuthToken();

  pool = new Pool({
    host: hostname,
    user: "admin",
    password: token,
    database,
    port: 5432,
    ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false },
  });

  return pool;
};

export const getDbInstance = async () => {
  const pool = await getDatabasePool();
  return drizzle(pool);
};

export const getDistributions = async () => {
  const db = await getDbInstance();
  return db.select().from(postsTable);
};
```
5. Define the Database Schema

Create a schema.ts file in src/db:
```typescript
import { integer, varchar, text, timestamp, pgSchema } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";

export const mySchema = pgSchema("davedennisdotdev_dev");
export const colors = mySchema.enum("colors", ["red", "green", "blue"]);

export const postsTable = mySchema.table("posts", {
  id: integer().primaryKey().generatedAlwaysAsIdentity(),
  title: varchar({ length: 255 }).notNull(),
  /* Additional columns can be uncommented and used as needed:
  slug: varchar({ length: 255 }).notNull().unique(),
  summary: text().notNull(),
  content: text().notNull(),
  coverImage: varchar({ length: 255 }),
  publishedAt: timestamp().defaultNow().notNull(),
  updatedAt: timestamp().defaultNow().notNull(),
  authorId: integer().notNull(),
  */
});
```
6. Test the Setup

Create a new .ts file to test database operations. For example:
```typescript
import { getDbInstance } from "./src/db";

(async () => {
  const db = await getDbInstance();

  // Insert a test post
  await db.insert(postsTable).values({
    title: "First Post",
  });

  // Retrieve posts
  const posts = await db.select().from(postsTable);
  console.log(posts);
})();
```
