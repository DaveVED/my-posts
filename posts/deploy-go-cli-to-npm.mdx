  I'm working on some projects that require templating. If you work with TypeScript, you know it doesn't support templating well. I have been following Bun for some time and know they use Zig, but have packaged their tools for npm. I am going to figure out how to deploy my Go CLI to npm, so users can run `npx create-xyz@latest` with Go running in the background.

Ok, so I want to build a cli tool that is along the lines of `npx create-xyz@latest`.
