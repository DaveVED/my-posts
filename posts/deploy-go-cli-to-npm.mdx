I want to build a CLI tool similar to `npx create-xyz@latest`, but I don't want
most of my logic living in TypeScript. Why? Because it lacks support for
templating. To be fair, it really has no support for it at all. Who does have
support for templating?

Zig seemed to do something similar with Bun, so we should be able to do
something similar with a different language, for example, Python, using the
[`copier framework`](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which works
well. And of course, there's Go. Go offers robust templating support through its
[_`text/template`_](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) and
[_`html/template packages`_](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template), making it an
ideal choice for creating a flexible and powerful CLI tool.

For this exmaple, I'm going to go with Go (lol). More folks might appreciate the
copier framework (since Python is more user-friendly, depending on who you ask),
but in my opinion, Go is easier to get up and running with thanks to go mod
init.

Anyways, this blog is going to cover the basics: _let's deploy a Hello World Go
CLI to npm_ so we can do something like `npx create-xyz@latest`.

## Directory Setup

I've been going back and forth with this, but for this example, we'll go with
the bare minimum that will allow us to get a Go CLI deployed to npm and meet our
acceptance criteria (display `hello world!`). We'll end up with something like
this:

```bash
├── go
│   ├── go.mod
│   ├── main.go
│   └── Makefile
├── LICENSE
└── node
    ├── bin
    │   └── turborepo-blueprint
    ├── dist
    │   ├── ...
    ├── package.json
    ├── package-lock.json
    └── tsconfig.json
```

It's simple and straightforward and will prevent confusion for this basic
example. So let's get started with it.

## Getting Started

We're sticking to the basics here with everyone's favorite `Hello World`
application. For this example, the Go application will simply print
`"Hello World"` to your terminal. Something like this:

```bash
➜ npx turborepo-blueprint
Hello World
```

It's that straightforward. We just want to prove we can do this!

### Creating Your Go App

Setting up a Go app is easier than any other framework (in my opinion). We're
going to do this:

```bash
mkdir go && cd go
go mod init github.com/DaveVED/turborepo-blueprint
```

You can then create a file called `main.go` with minimal input:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello World")
}
```

Then test it if you'd like.

### The Makefile

To create a Makefile, we'll require the binaries for the Node wrapper. We'll be
short, sweet, and to the point for now. One thing to note is that you will need
to create your node folder, or some OS will complain.

```bash
BINARY_NAME=turborepo-blueprint

build-linux:
	GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o ../node/bin/$(BINARY_NAME) main.go

build-mac:
	GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o ../node/bin/$(BINARY_NAME) main.go

build-windows:
	GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o ../node/bin/$(BINARY_NAME).exe main.go

build-all: build-linux build-mac build-windows
```

You can test this out if you'd like. But once we have this basic binary, we can
move forward. Linux is all I really care about right now, but you can also run
make build-all.

```bash
➜ make build-linux
➜ ls ../node/bin/turborepo-blueprint
```

> we will use `build-all` at the end, this is just to show you.

### The node wrapper

This part might seem easy, but it turned out to be more challenging than
expected. We need a way to execute the Go CLI without requiring users to have Go
installed on their machines, and ideally without them even knowing it's there.

#### Setting up the typescript directory

Let's first initialize the project:

```bash
➜ cd ../node
➜ npm init -y
➜ npm install typescript @types/node
```

> Normally, we add a `-D` tag here to only add it as a dev dependency, but I
> faced some issues with users not having TypeScript installed, so why not force
> it?

You can then configure your `./node/tsconfig.json.` I use a pretty standard
template, but you can read a great blog post
[here](https://www.totaltypescript.com/tsconfig-cheat-sheet) on some of these.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2022",
    "module": "NodeNext",
    "outDir": "dist",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "declaration": true,
    "declarationMap": true,
    "lib": ["es2022"]
  },
  "include": ["index.ts"]
}
```

With that, you have the basic repository setup required.

#### Creating the typescript wrapper

At a high level, all we need to do is ensure we install the correct binary on
the correct machine.

> Make sure you bundle your binary with your distribution.

Create an `index.ts` file with the following content:

```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env node

import { execFileSync } from 'child_process';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';
import * as path from 'path';
import * as os from 'os';
import * as fs from 'fs';

/**
 * Get the directory name of the current module.
 * @returns The directory name of the current module.
 */
function getDirname(): string {
  const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
  return path.dirname(__filename);
}

/**
 * Determine the path to the binary based on the operating system platform.
 * @param dirname - The directory name of the current module.
 * @returns The path to the binary.
 */
function getBinaryPath(dirname: string): string {
  const platform = os.platform();

  switch (platform) {
    case 'linux':
    case 'darwin':
      return path.resolve(dirname, 'bin/turborepo-blueprint');
    case 'win32':
      return path.resolve(dirname, 'bin/turborepo-blueprint.exe');
    default:
      console.error(`Unsupported platform: ${platform}`);
      process.exit(1);
  }
}

/**
 * Check if the binary exists at the determined path.
 * @param binaryPath - The path to the binary.
 */
function checkBinaryExists(binaryPath: string): void {
  if (!fs.existsSync(binaryPath)) {
    console.error(`Binary not found at path: ${binaryPath}`);
    process.exit(1);
  }
}

/**
 * Ensure the binary has execute permissions on Unix-based systems.
 * @param binaryPath - The path to the binary.
 * @param platform - The operating system platform.
 */
function setExecutePermissions(binaryPath: string, platform: string): void {
  if (platform !== 'win32') {
    try {
      fs.chmodSync(binaryPath, '755');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Failed to set execute permissions on binary: ${error}`);
      process.exit(1);
    }
  }
}

/**
 * Execute the binary and handle any errors.
 * @param binaryPath - The path to the binary.
 */
function executeBinary(binaryPath: string): void {
  try {
    execFileSync(binaryPath, { stdio: 'inherit' });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to run the binary:', error);
    process.exit(1);
  }
}

// Main function to coordinate the execution
function main(): void {
  const dirname = getDirname();
  const binaryPath = getBinaryPath(dirname);
  checkBinaryExists(binaryPath);
  setExecutePermissions(binaryPath, os.platform());
  executeBinary(binaryPath);
}

// Execute the main function
main();
```

Now you can test this with the current setup before we publish it.

```bash
➜ npm run build
➜ chmod +x dist/index.js # for local testing run this
➜ npx turborepo-blueprint
➜ Hello World
```

### Publishing with Changeset

Versioning and publishing packages on npm can be cumbersome. To streamline this
process, I prefer using Changeset, which handles versioning and changelogs
automatically.

#### Installing Changeset

To get started with Changeset, you need to install it as a development
dependency in your project:

```sh
➜ npm install @changesets/cli -D
```

Next, initialize Changeset in your project. This will create a .changeset folder
and a configuration file.

```sh
➜ npx changeset init
```

#### Creating a Changeset

Whenever you make changes that you want to release, create a new changeset. This
will prompt you to describe the changes and generate a markdown file in the
`.changeset ` directory.

```sh
➜ npx changeset
```

Follow the prompts to describe your changes.

#### Committing the Changeset

After creating a changeset, commit it to your version control system (e.g.,
Git):

```sh
➜ git add .changeset
➜ git commit -m "Add changeset for new changes"
```

#### Versioning and Changelog Generation

When you’re ready to release, run the following command to bump versions and
generate changelogs:

```sh
➜ npx changeset version
```

This command updates the version in your package.json and creates or updates the
changelog.

#### Deploying the Package

Finally, publish your package to npm:

```sh
➜ npm publish
```

> You can always autmoate this with a cli if you want, vercel has a greate
> exmaple.

## Try it out

You can try it out, assuming you have a valid package:

```sh
➜  temp npm view @daveved/turborepo-blueprint
