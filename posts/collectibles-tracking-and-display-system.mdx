  I've gotten really into collectibles lately. Well, I guess I've always been
  into them, but now I'm at a place where I can embrace the hobby. With this,
  I've faced one major problem: I don't really have a good way to track my stuff
  outside my brain so it's hard to share without word of mouth, and I don't
  really have a way to show others besides having them over. To tackle this, I'm
  going to build a simple tracking and display system (maybe one day I'll add a
  bid system, we'll see).

I've gotten really into collectibles lately. Well, I guess I've always been into
them, but now I'm at a place where I can embrace the hobby. With this, I've
faced one major problem (well, two).

## The Problems

The two main problems I'm trying to solve can be outlined as follows:

1. I have started to accumulate a lot of stuff, and tracking is hard. Right now,
   it's all tracked inside my brain. While some sets provide you with nice lists
   (take the Pokémon
   [TCG: Scarlet & Violet—151](file:///home/daveved/Downloads/scarlet-violet-151-card-list.pdf))
   for your items, etc., it's not ideal for me. I would like a digital workspace
   for all my stuff.
2. I'd like to be able to show some of this off, but right now I can't without
   having people over. I'd like to be able to share my collection without that.

There is a third problem regarding wanting to sell this stuff, but I'll tackle
that later. Right now, I'm a collector, not a seller, and if you ask my wife, it
will probably always be that way. I get attached to my items.

## The Architecture

There were a few key architecture questions I needed to answer before getting started.

### Where Should This Live (Domain)

I've been going back and forth with this, and there are only really two logical options for me here.

1. I can just let it live under [davedennis.dev](https://davedennis.dev) and create a `collectibles` path.
2. I can create a subdomain [collectibles.davedennis.dev](https://collectibles.davedennis.dev).

For whatever reason, I've decided to go with option two and have it as a subdomain. I might turn this into a shopping cart someday, which was the main driver here. I'd like to keep the logic isolated.

### Where Should This Live (GitHub)

My personal site [davedennis.dev](https://davedennis.dev) is set up with [Turbo Repo](https://turbo.build/) [*monorepo solution*](https://turbo.build/repo/docs#the-monorepo-solution) and I love it. If it was a net new domain, I'd create a new repo for this, but since it's a subdomain, I'm going to just add a new `app` to my monorepo. It'll look something like this:

```bash
├── apps
│   └── web // This is my core davedennis.dev site.
│       ├── ...
│   └── collectibles // This is the new collectibles site.
│       ├── ...
├── package.json
├── packages
│   ├── eslint-config
│   │   ├── ...
│   ├── typescript-config
│   │   ├── ...
│   └── ui
│       ├── ...
├── pnpm-lock.yaml
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml
├── README.md
└── turbo.json
```

It's very straightforward and it's going to let me grow my [davedennis.dev](https://davedennis.dev) domain as needed. And a direct [quote](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/structuring-a-repository#specifying-packages-in-a-monorepo) for this setup from them. See here for more details.

> We recommend starting with splitting your packages into apps/ for applications and services and packages/ for everything else, like libraries and tooling.

### Where Should This Live (Hosting)

The recommend way to deploy Next apps is via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/overview) which makes sense as they created the framework. I on the other hand am an AWS guy, so I am just going to expand on my current architecture on AWS, for this. A high level diagram is as follows. I will note i'm sure vercel is great for hosting (granted i've read some horor stories about people getting surpoise bills but that's just the servless life), and I do think I shoudl give it a try, maybe for my next pet proejct (which I probalby wont finish - HA).

![Collectibles Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DaveVED/my-posts/main/posts/collectibles-tracking-and-display-system/architecture.jpeg)

I'm going to also touch on a few things that you may be asking your self, to just clear the air, I won't make any other justifications, otherwise (it's my site, so who would care).

- Yes, I thought about s3. I use to run on it, but I wanted server side redering, and i'll 100% need it for this. The CloudFront + s3 setup was always free so that was a win, but with this setup I am just really incuring the cost of the ALB it's not the great debt, and worth the cost for me. 
- This diagram does not show networking it's high level.

### Authentication

Both my sites need auth. For the blog for things like comments, likes, etc.. For the collectibles, I want to add in a shop one day (I keep saying this I may just do it.). The soultion for me here is simple, as *I WILL NOT ROLL OUT MY OWN AUTH*. So I went with this.

- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/)- This is a nice framework and supports a lot of providers.
- [Auth0 by Okta](https://auth0.com/) - For my AuthZ/AuthN, pretty simple setup.

Auth0 does proivde there own framwork but I wnated to play around with NextAuth.

## Bootstrapping a new app

As noted we're going to be using the turbo monorepo, so I don't need to make a new GitHub project or anything. I simply need to bootstrap a new app in my current repo. I'm going to start pretty bare bones, so I'm not going to use their `npx` starter for now. Here is what I'm doing.

### Step 1 - Create a `./apps/collectibles` directory.

### Step 3 - Create the root files at `./apps/collectibles`:
#### The `./tsconfig.json` file

TypeScript configuration file. Which will extend our shared common config in our packages `"extends": "@repo/typescript-config/nextjs.json"`

```json
{
  "extends": "@repo/typescript-config/nextjs.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "plugins": [
      {
        "name": "next"
      }
    ]
  },
  "include": [
    "next-env.d.ts",
    "next.config.js",
    "**/*.ts",
    "**/*.tsx",
    ".next/types/**/*.ts"
  ],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

#### The `./tailwind.config.ts` file.

Tailwind CSS configuration file. For now we just define the conent, and nothing else, we'll expand on it as needed.
```typescript
import type { Config } from "tailwindcss";

const config: Config = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{ts,tsx,mdx,md,js}"]
};

export default config;
```

#### The `./README.md`

Project README file.

#### `./postcss.config.js`
PostCSS configuration file. Should be empty but you can update later

```javascript
// If you want to use other PostCSS plugins, see the following:
// https://tailwindcss.com/docs/using-with-preprocessors

module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
};
```

#### The `./next.config.js` file.
Next.js configuration file.

#### The `./package.json` file.

Project manifest file. Ensure the app runs on a port that is not taken. I am using 3001 as my other app is running on 3000.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev --turbo --port 3001",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint",
    "type-check": "tsc --noEmit"
  },
```

#### The `./Dockerfile` file.

Docker configuration file for containerizing the app.

#### The `./.gitignore` file

Git ignore file specifying which files to ignore in version control.

#### The `./.eslintrc.js` file.

ESLint configuration file. This uses the common configs from shared pacakge as well.

```javascript
/** @type {import("eslint").Linter.Config} */
module.exports = {
  root: true,
  extends: ["@repo/eslint-config/next.js"],
  parser: "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  parserOptions: {
    project: true,
  },
};
```

#### The `./.env.local` file.

Environment variables file for local development.

### Step 4 - Create `./apps/collectibles/styles`

#### Create `./globals.css` file
Global CSS styles. If using tailwind must have the required `@`
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### Create `./src` directory

#### Create the `layout.tsx` file
This is a wrapper pretty much, in next they have the concept of layouts, it's a Layout component for the app. We will start simple, with just the clidren pretty much.
```typescript
import type { Metadata } from "next";
import "../../styles/globals.css";

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Dave Dennis",
  description: "Dave Dennis personal portfolio",
};

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className="h-full w-full overflow-y-auto"> {children} </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

#### `page.tsx` file

Main page component for the app. We will start with a hello world.

```typescript
export default function LandingPage() {
  return (
    <main>
      Hello World
    </main>
  );
}
```

#### The `./public` file
      > Static files directory.
