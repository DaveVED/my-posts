excerpt: "I've gotten really into collectibles lately. Well, I guess I've always been into them, but now I'm at a place where I can embrace the hobby. With this, I've faced one major problem, which is, I don't really have a good way to 1. track my stuff outside my brain so it's hard to share without word of mouth, and 2. I don't really have a way to show others besides having them over. To tackle this, I'm going to build a simple tracking and display system (maybe one day I'll add a bid system, we'll see)."
