  I've gotten really into collectibles lately. Well, I guess I've always been
  into them, but now I'm at a place where I can embrace the hobby. With this,
  I've faced one major problem: I don't really have a good way to track my stuff
  outside my brain so it's hard to share without word of mouth, and I don't
  really have a way to show others besides having them over. To tackle this, I'm
  going to build a simple tracking and display system (maybe one day I'll add a
  bid system, we'll see).

I've gotten really into collectibles lately. Well, I guess I've always been into
them, but now I'm at a place where I can embrace the hobby. With this, I've
faced one major problem (well, two).

## The Problems

The two main problems I'm trying to solve can be outlined as follows:

1. I have started to accumulate a lot of stuff, and tracking is hard. Right now,
   it's all tracked inside my brain. While some sets provide you with nice lists
   (take the Pokémon
   [TCG: Scarlet & Violet—151](file:///home/daveved/Downloads/scarlet-violet-151-card-list.pdf))
   for your items, etc., it's not ideal for me. I would like a digital workspace
   for all my stuff.
2. I'd like to be able to show some of this off, but right now I can't without
   having people over. I'd like to be able to share my collection without that.

There is a third problem regarding wanting to sell this stuff, but I'll tackle
that later. Right now, I'm a collector, not a seller, and if you ask my wife, it
will probably always be that way. I get attached to my items.
