  Hands up, I love monorepos, but organizing them and finding the correct tooling is not the easiest thing in the world. Over the last year, I've decided that my favorite tech stack for npm packages and similar projects is using Turborepo to manage the monorepo and Changesets for versioning multiple packages. This setup enables a very clean directory structure. Vercel has published decent examples, but they are all over the place and the changesets example requires a lot of copy paste. I am going to create a cli tool to allow dynamic generation of these examples from a single blueprint.

Hands up, I love monorepos, but organizing them and finding the correct tooling is not the easiest thing in the world. Over the last year, I've decided that my favorite tech stack for npm packages and similar projects is using Turborepo to manage the monorepo and Changesets for versioning multiple packages. This setup enables a very clean directory structure. Vercel has published decent examples, but they are all over the place and the changesets example requires a lot of copy paste. I am going to create a CLI tool to allow dynamic generation of these examples from a single blueprint.

## A Deeper Look at the Problem

All of the turbo examples can be found on their [GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/turbo/tree/main/examples), and as you'll see, they have *great* examples and *a lot* of examples. But the way the examples were built achieves one thing for each example, and some of the examples require many interventions (for example, the changeset one). If I wanted to use the changeset with, say, the Tailwind example, I have to manually merge them. It's sort of a pain. Why not have a central CLI tool that takes in some basic inputs and builds the repo with everything you need? Well, that's what I'm going to attempt to do.

> Please note, the initial build is going to focus on changesets and Tailwind. I will add others as I go. But please don't expect this blog to cover them all.

## Project Initialization

Ok this might differ than some projects you've seen as i'm mixing golang and node. I'm going to go with a simple directory setup like such.

```bash
turborepo-blueprint/
├── go/
│   ├── main.go
│   ├── Makefile
│   └── go.mod
├── node/
│   ├── src/
│   │   └── index.ts
│   ├── bin/
│   │   └── my-go-cli
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── tsconfig.json
│   └── .changeset/
│       └── README.md
└── README.md
```

It's going to allow me to isolate the golang features from the node, and still keep a small clean repo.

### Step 1 - Setup the Go Program

We're going to start simple as i'd like to ensure the node wrapper works, so for the golang i'm going to just print a `hello world` to the terminal for now. 

```bash
mkdir go && cd go
go mod init github.com/DaveVED/turborepo-blueprint
```

You can then create a file called `main.go` with minial input.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

Then test it if you'd like.

With that we're done with go code for now (of course we have so much to do, I want to verify this works first).

#### Step 2 - The Makefile

I lied we'll need to create a makefile as we'll requrie the binarys for the node wrapper. We'll be short, sweet and to the point for now. The one thing to note is that you will *need to create your node folder* or some OS will complain.

```
BINARY_NAME=turborepo-blueprint

build-linux:
    GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o ../node/bin/$(BINARY_NAME) main.go

build-mac:
    GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o ../node/bin/$(BINARY_NAME) main.go

build-windows:
    GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o ../node/bin/$(BINARY_NAME).exe main.go

build-all: build-linux build-mac build-windows
```

You can test this out, if you'd like. But once we have this basic binary we can move forward, linux is all I really care about right now, but you can also run the `make build-all`.

```bash
make build-linux
ls ../node/bin/turborepo-blueporint
```

#### Step 3 - Seting up the Node.js Wrapper with Typescript

Ok now all that's left before we can publish and do the simple test is setting up the Node wrapper. We'll start simple.

```bash
cd ../node
npm init -y
npm install typescript @types/node --save-dev
```

You can then configure your `./node/tsconfig.json`. I use a pretty standard tempalte. But you can read a great blog post [here](https://www.totaltypescript.com/tsconfig-cheat-sheet) on some of these.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    /* Base Options: */
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "target": "es2022",
    "allowJs": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "moduleDetection": "force",
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "verbatimModuleSyntax": true,

    /* Strictness */
    "strict": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true,

    /* If transpiling with TypeScript: */
    "module": "NodeNext",
    "outDir": "dist",
    "sourceMap": true,

    /* AND if you're building for a library: */
    "declaration": true,

    /* AND if you're building for a library in a monorepo: */
    "composite": true,
    "declarationMap": true,

    /* If your code doesn't run in the DOM: */
    "lib": ["es2022"]
  }
}
```

And then we can create the wrapper.

```typescript
import { execFileSync } from 'child_process';
import * as path from 'path';
import * as os from 'os';

const platform = os.platform();
let binaryPath: string;

switch (platform) {
  case 'linux':
    binaryPath = path.join(__dirname, '../bin', 'turborepo-blueprint');
    break;
  case 'darwin':
    binaryPath = path.join(__dirname, '../bin', 'turborepo-blueprint');
    break;
  case 'win32':
    binaryPath = path.join(__dirname, '../bin', 'turborepo-blueprint.exe');
    break;
  default:
    console.error(`Unsupported platform: ${platform}`);
    process.exit(1);
}

try {
  execFileSync(binaryPath, { stdio: 'inherit' });
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to run the Go binary:', error);
  process.exit(1);
}
```
