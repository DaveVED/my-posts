With this, i've faced one major probelm, which is, I don't really have a good way to 1. track my stuff outside my brain so it's hard to share without word of mouth, and 2. I don't really have a way to show others besides having them over. To tackle this, i'm going to build a simple tracking and display system (maybe oneday i'll add a bid system we'll see).",
