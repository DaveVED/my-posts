Rather than using TypeScript, which lacks robust templating support, I prefer Go for its powerful `text/template` and `html/template` packages. This approach allows me to create a flexible and effective CLI tool, comparable to Python's [Copier framework](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).",
