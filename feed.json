However, I've encountered a significant issue: I don't have an efficient way to track my collection outside of my memory, making it difficult to share details without word of mouth. Additionally, displaying my collection to others is limited to in-person visits. To address these challenges, I'm going to build a simple tracking and display system. Perhaps one day I'll even add a bidding system; we'll see.",

I have been following Bun for some time and know they use Zig, but have packaged their tools for npm. I am going to figure out how to deploy my Go CLI to npm, so users can run `npx create-xyz@latest` with Go running in the background.",
