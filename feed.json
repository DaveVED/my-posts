      "excerpt": "I want to build a CLI tool similar to `npx create-xyz@latest`, but I don't want most of my logic in TypeScript because it lacks support for templating. Python has good support with the [*copier framework*](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), but Go, with its robust templating support through `text/template` and `html/template` packages, is my preferred choice for creating a flexible and powerful CLI tool.",
